Hello!

FOR THE FUNCTIONAL PROTOTYPE, RUN main.py ON TERMINAL! 
That is what is finished and functional!

Rasa is included here following the instruction on the email to "turn in
what you have".

As per the instructions in the email, we did not finish working on Rasa.
The current Rasa setup is basically the first steps, starting to set up domain
and stories.

The next step would be to finish setting this up basically as an FAQ answerer,
following the tutorial, then add the ability to track which step we are in 
and store recipe details, which would get us to basic functionality.


Thank you for a great quarter! We hope you and everyone working on this course
stays safe during the pandemic.
